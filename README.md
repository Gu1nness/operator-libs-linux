# Operator Linux Libs (operator-libs-linux)

## Description

operator-libs-linux is a set of [charm libraries] which can be used for managing and manipulating
Debian packages, Snap packages, system repositories, users and groups, and other operations needed
for machine charm usage on Linux.

## Usage

Each library contains information on usage and code examples. They are meant to be complete as
standalone libraries, and should be managed as [charm libraries], with installation via `fetch-lib`,
after which they may be imported and used as normal charms.

## Contributing
